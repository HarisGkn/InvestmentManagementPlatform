# InvestmentManagementPlatform

A Spring Boot-based backend system designed for managing investment portfolios, transactions, dividends, and user accounts with role-based access control. Developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, the project features JWT authentication, centralized exception handling, audit logging for investment changes, and a clean layered architecture. It follows modern best practices in security, modular design, and unit testing, and exposes a RESTful API documented with Swagger.
